# 👦🏻 Hi, I am Karan Gupta

## Engineering | Software Design | UX

I deal with complex technical challenges and functional domain on a day to day basis. Been interested in programming since my childhood and now I get paid to live my dream everyday. I take a keen interest in software design & architecture and my philosophy is to avoid over-engineering and prefer solutions that fit the problem.
