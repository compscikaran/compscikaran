# üë¶üèª Hi, I am Karan Gupta

I am just trying to build software that serves a purpose and does something useful.

Software Engineering is not just a discipline, its the amalgamation of development, design, mindset and culture.
I believe in learning from others so below are few curated conference talks and podcasts which I found to be very insightful
