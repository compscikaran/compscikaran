# 👦🏻 Hi, I am Karan Gupta

## Software Engineering | UX | Software Design

I deal with complex technical challenges and functional domain on a day to day basis. Been interested in programming since my childhood and now I get paid to live my dream everyday. Always willing to listen and explore alternate approaches and come up with pragmatic solutions. I think simplicity and moderation are underrated. I am opinionated and biased when it comes to design philosophy but I am also willing to change my positions if I see solid evidence / arguments to the contrary.
I believe that there is an aspect of artistry and craftsmanship to my profession regardless of whether what you are working on is large or small, complex or simple.
